# ChatClient

 Build a chat client in JavaFX, which should send messages to server software, which you will also write.

The chat window should just have a large space (e.g., text area, list view) to hold the entire conversation.  It should have a text field to enter the current message, and a button to send it. 

YOU refers to the individual typing in the current window, and FRIEND is the other client instance.  The server only needs to handle two clients at a time.  They’re always called YOU and FRIEND.  “YOU” is always you, and “FRIEND” refers to the other person, from the perspective of the client software. 

The server software should write the full conversation to console, as well.
